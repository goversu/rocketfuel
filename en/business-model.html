        <h1>business model</h1>
        <p>seems too good to be true?</p>
        <p>not really, the other companies just need more money because they have to hire lots of staff. here's how we make money:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>distribution fee</strong><br>we pay less than $18 per year per person to distribute your music, so we make a small profit there. we think it is fair to charge $1.50 a month especially since it's the lowest rate on the public market for individuals</li>
            <li><strong>investments</strong><br>we invest your balance in liquidity funds regulated by monetary authority of singapore, with an average of 2.27% per annum returns since inception (as of september 2024), with extremely low risk (risk is taken by us, you always get 2% p.a.)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>in addition, as we are a registered business, we also get tax benefits whenever we fund your projects and pay your distribution/license fees</p>
