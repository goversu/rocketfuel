            <h2>why choose songGate:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>non exclusive</strong><br>sometimes, creators need resources that we cannot provide effectively or are outside our area of expertise. we understand that. you are free to work with or sign with any other entities, and withdraw from songGate with no penalty anytime</li>
                <li><strong>we take 0%</strong><br>we’re tired of seeing other agencies take large percentages from their talents, where the only value they provide is a small boost in views and an upfront advance. you do not have to transfer us any money, but we will take $10 a year from your royalties (you will not have to top up negative balances)</li>
                <li><strong>project funding</strong><br>upfront costs for music projects can be very daunting. we fund projects that we think will be profitable and take royalties from the release until we make the money back (it’s a 0% interest loan + your risk is absorbed and you get expert guidance!!)</li>
                <li><strong>earn interest</strong><br>transfer methods incur large fees, often a % + fixed fee, and a large fixed fee for wire transfers. many creators choose to hold money with their distributors until they need it or it adds up to sizeable amounts. at songGate, we don’t just let your money rot there. we give you 2% per annum interest on any of your money we hold, and you can submit a withdrawal request anytime at no additional fee (there is a distributor fee of $1 + paypal fees)</li>
                <li><strong>networking</strong><br>we have access to a wide network of talents, producers, writers, artists, singers, etc., and can find just the collab or service you need to create something amazing. don’t underestimate the potential in combining the abilities of like-minded, passionate creatives! in addition, you can get advice from experienced industry professionals; so many opportunities for growth</li>
